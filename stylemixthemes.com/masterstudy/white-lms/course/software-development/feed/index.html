			<p>The primary goal of this quick start guide is to introduce you to Unreal Engine 4`s (UE4) development environment. By the end of this guide, you`ll know how to set up and develop C++ Projects in UE4. This guide shows you how to create a new Unreal Engine project, add a new C++ class to it, compile the project, and add an instance of a new class to your level. By the time you reach the end of this guide, you`ll be able to see your programmed Actor floating above a table in the level.</p>
<p>This quick start guide shows you how to add assets to your Unreal Engine (UE4) games. By the end of this guide, you`ll know how to use the Project Browser to create new projects and navigate the Content Browser to find and add content. You`ll also know where to find information on the FBX Content Pipeline while learning how to use the Material Editor to modify Materials before applying them to a Static Mesh Actor.</p>
